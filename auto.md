# Things to be aware of
1. <a name="N001"></a>The Volkswagen Atlas has a high fuel consumption and large turning radius.
1. <a name="N002"></a>2020 is the first model year for the Kia Telluride.
1. <a name="N003"></a>Crossbars and other accessories are currently unavailable for the Kia Telluride.
1. <a name="N004"></a>The 7-seater models of the
Toyota Highlander are not sufficient for our needs.
Unfortunately this eliminates the following
desired items:
    - Heated steering wheel
    - SE package with black-on-white badging.
1. <a name="N005"></a>The Toyota Highlander's 27"
crossbar spread is too narrow for carrying the V8 and the Eze. V-bars would be needed. The total additional cost would be about $1000.
1. <a name="N006"></a>The Honda Passport is
about 30cm wider than other vehicles in its class.
Power folding side mirrors are available
on the Touring trim.
1. <a name="N007"></a>The Subaru Forester has a CVT.
Reviews indicate that vehicle acceleration is poor.
1. <a name="N008"></a>The Subaru Ascent has a CVT.
