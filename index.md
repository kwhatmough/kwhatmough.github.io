- Don: with the armour stone running under the landing at midway between the front and back row of posts (versus the original plan of under the front row of posts) the question becomes what to do with the front row of posts (but I do agree that this is a better approach than before), also: for the sake of stability how large can we make the 6 sonotubes that are behind the armour stone?, and finally: there is less fill now with the armour stone where it is (which is good) but can we go to a larger gravel size (e.g., 4") (I believe the original plan was 2") to avoid wash-out? ACTUALLY I don't think poured sonotubes are possible now because the water is too high (i.e., it's too late) so maybe we omit them and build a well around the posts instead with the hopes that the water level will soon return to normal(?) or are large pre-cast blocks an option (despite the lack of a level footing)?

- pivot is keyed but needs to be secured for transport, brace the pedals and the understern and the overstern, double-back the ends of the control line then place the wedge at the apex of the loop then slowly take-up slack (careful - this is not easily reversible) then fine adjust and finally lock with pin and then fasten the wedges to the pivot and insert cotter pins, for pull-up line: note the knob through which to feed the pull-line, so feed bike wire then dental floss then the pull-line otherwise it will jam inside https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp7NPU7QkoY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=130dOQvHuWU https://www.jyllingesejlklub.dk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/smarttrack-top-mount.pdf See "knot slot" (so good we are not missing anything) GIP60171I718 EKI2016
